## 763 Partition Labels

A string `S` of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

```

**Note:**

1. `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
2. `S` will consist of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.



- 解法：每次更新最后一个分割字符的坐标,可以带入一个字符串试试

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
        vector<int> pos(26,0);
        // record the last time each letter appears
        for(int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
            pos[S[i]-'a'] = i;
        }
        int idx = -1,last_i=0;
        vector<int> res;
        for(int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
            idx = max(pos[S[i]-'a'],idx); // 记录当前字符串最末包括全部重复字符的位置
            if(i == idx){
                res.push_back(i-last_i+1);
                last_i = i+1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```



### 621. Task Scheduler

Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks.Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval **n** that means between two **same tasks**, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the **least** number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

**Note:**

1. The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2. The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

            cha[tasks[i]-'A'] ++;
        }
        int cnt = 0,tmp_n=n+1,maxx=0;
        for(int i=0;i<cha.size();i++){
            if(cha[i]==0)

                maxx = cha[i];
                cnt = 1;
            }else if(maxx==cha[i]){
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        int space = (n+1)*(maxx-1)+cnt;
        return (space>tasks.size()?space:tasks.size());
    }
};
